<h4>History of Plant 4 Us Foundation</h4>


<!-- History -->

<p>Plant 4 Us was started in 2019 when Covid-19 hit. It was founded by myself, Brooke Hammer and my older sister. We were looking outside of our house and saw people cutting down trees and we thought we needed to do something about it. So we started Plant 4 Us! A non-profit that plants trees around America. We have been able to get over 50,000 people volunteer in 30 different states.</p>
<br>


<h4>Plant 4 Us Goals</h4>


<!-- Paragraph on companies goals-->

<p>Here at Plant 4 US, we are looking to keep the population of the trees up around America and we hope to be able to plant over 1 million trees by 2030! In addition, we hope to be able to bring together the largest group of people ever to plant trees in an area that is heavily effected by wild fires.</p>
