<!-- description of myself -->

<p>I have been working hard with my older sister and brother to make this company grow ever since we started. I love the wilderness and going outside. I am very adventureous and love going to other states wildlife. This family company has created me to take more walks in the woods. While walking I can see the beautiful trees, even the trees the foundation has planted. I am going to college to pursure the interesting wildlife and outdoors. After graduating I want to go somewhere warm to continue this business. By making it grow world wide and help other communities by planting trees. I love planting trees, I have planted alot of the trees for this company awhile. When visiting the Tongass National Park it made me interested in trees to starting this foundation for the outdoors.</p>

<h3>Tongass National Park</h3>


<p>This rain forest is known as the Tongass National Park located in Alaska. It is the largest national park in the United States at just about 16.7 million acres. Also, this was the first place that we decided we should go and visit to plant trees. We believed that it would motivate us so that we could make al other areas and parks around us similar to the Tongass National Park.</p>
